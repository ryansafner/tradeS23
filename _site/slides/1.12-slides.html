# The Role of the Firm in Trade

.pull-left[
.smaller[
- Classical trade theory (Ricardo, Hecksher-Ohlin, etc) has no role for the firm!
  - might as well be people directly selling wheat or computers, etc.

- Once we jettison the unrealistic assumption of perfect competition `\((p=MC)\)`, we can say a lot more about firms and trade

- We move to a theory of .hi[imperfect competition]: where firms have market power (but not full market power, as in a monopoly)
