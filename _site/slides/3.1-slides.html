  - One of the few countries that regulated immigration by race

- **Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882**: virtually banned all immigration from China until repeal in 1943

  - Implied Northern &amp; Western Europeans had much higher quotas
  - No limits on immigration from Latin America; or for high-skilled individuals

- **Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965** abolished quotas
  - resulted in influx of non-European immigration

Lawful immigrants made up the majority of the immigrant workforce, at 21.2 million. An additional 7.6 million immigrant workers are unauthorized immigrants, less than the total of the previous year and notably less than in 2007, when they were 8.2 million. They alone account for 4.6% of the civilian labor force, a dip from their peak of 5.4% in 2007.”

# Attitudes Towards Immigration

.pull-left[
.tiny[
&gt; “While immigration has been at the forefront of a national political debate, the U.S. public holds a range of views about immigrants living in the country. Overall, a majority of Americans have positive views about immigrants. About two-thirds of  Americans (66%) say immigrants strengthen the country “because of their hard work and talents,” while about a quarter (24%) say immigrants burden the country by taking jobs, housing and health care.”

&gt; “Yet these views vary starkly by political affiliation. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, 88% think immigrants strengthen the country with their hard work and talents, and just 8% say they are a burden. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 41% say immigrants strengthen the country, while 44% say they burden it.”

&gt; “Americans were divided on future levels of immigration. A quarter said legal immigration to the U.S. should be decreased (24%), while one-third (38%) said immigration should be kept at its present level and almost another third (32%) said immigration should be increased.”

# America Depends on Working Immigrants

&gt; Solorio is one of a growing number of agricultural businessmen who say they face an urgent shortage of workers....“Look, we are paying $14.50 now, but we are going up to $16.” 

&gt; That has made California farms a proving ground for the Trump team’s theory that by cutting off the flow of immigrants they will free up more jobs for American-born workers and push up their wages.

&gt; So far, the results aren’t encouraging for farmers or domestic workers.

&gt; But the raises and new perks have not tempted native-born Americans to leave their day jobs for the fields. Nine in 10 agriculture workers in California are still foreign born, and more than half are undocumented, according to a federal survey.

# Economists on Immigration

.pull-left[

.tiny[
&gt; “We view the benefits of immigration as myriad:
Immigration brings entrepreneurs who start new businesses that hire American workers.
Immigration brings young workers who help offset the large-scale retirement of baby boomers.
Immigration brings diverse skill sets that keep our workforce flexible, help companies grow, and increase the productivity of American workers.
Immigrants are far more likely to work in innovative, job-creating fields such as science, technology, engineering, and math that create life-improving products and drive economic growth.

&gt; Immigration undoubtedly has economic costs as well, particularly for Americans in certain industries and Americans with lower levels of educational attainment. But the benefits that immigration brings to society far outweigh their costs, and smart immigration policy could better maximize the benefits of immigration while reducing the costs.”

But should they fail in this war of extermination, sickly seasons, epidemics, pestilence, and plague advance in terrific array, and sweep off their thousands and tens of thousands. Should success be still incomplete, gigantic inevitable famine stalks in the rear, and with one mighty blow levels the population with the food of the world.”

- Basic price theory: demand for resource raises its price
  - Induces recycling, more efficient utilization of resources, development of substitute goods and innovations
  - "It takes much less copper now to pass a given message than a hundred years ago."

- "Engineering" vs. "economic" forecasting:
  - "Engineering forcecasting" takes the amount of physical resources known to be available and substracts an extraplolation of current use rates from this
    - these are often famously wrong
  - "Economic" forecasting: need to include undiscovered sources, sources not yet economically feasible to extract, sources not yet technologically feasible to extract (note they are different!)

- The ultimate resource is *people*!

- More people `\(\implies\)` greater extent of the market `\(\implies\)` more division of labor `\(\implies\)` more specialization `\(\implies\)` more productivity

- More chances to have an Einstein or a Mozart

# People as Stomachs vs. Brains

.tiny[
&gt; "The nonrivalry of technology, as modeled in the endogenous growth literature, implies that high population spurs technological change. This paper constructs and empirically tests a model of long-run world population growth combining this implication with the Malthusian assumption that technology limits population. The model predicts that over most of history, the growth rate of population will be proportional to its level. Empirical tests support this prediction and show that historically, among societies with no possibility for technological contact, those with larger initial populations have had faster technological change and population growth," (p.681)


&gt; "[H]olding constant the share of resources devoted to research, an increase in population leads to an increase in technological change...This paper argues that the long-run history of population growth and technological change is consistent with the population implications of models of endogenous technological change...even if each person's research productivity is independent of population, total research output will increase with population due to the nonrivalry of technology. As Kuznets [1960] and Simon [1977, 1981] argue, a higher population means more potential inventors.," (p.681-684)

# The Causes of Economic Growth

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Consider a simple aggregate production function
`$$Y=f(A,eL,K)$$`
    - `\(Y\)`: GDP 
    - `\(A\)`: technology
    - `\(e\)`: Education/human capital
    - `\(L\)`: labor
    - `\(K\)`: physical capital

- Population growth raises `\(L\)` and therefore raises `\(Y\)` (i.e. GDP)
    - Can come either from *births* or *immigration*

# The Demographic Transition

.pull-left[
- The .hi[“Demographic transition”]: as countries develop, their fertility rates (number of births per woman) tend to decrease 
  - Lower infant mortality rate (more surviving children)
  - Higher opportunity cost for women to stay out of the work force 
  - Children become an object of love more than a source of free (agricultural) labor
