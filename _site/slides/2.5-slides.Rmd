# Free Trade & Classical Economics

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- With the classical economists demolishing mercantilist policy, the ideology of the 19<sup>th</sup> century favored free trade

- However, free trade has rarely been good politics (we will see why soon)
  - Many tariffs & restrictions remained

- Mercantilism and protectionism have always been crude self-interest arguments at others’ expense

- Needed more sophisticated protectionist arguments to rebut economic theory

- A Royal Marines officer, fought in Napoleonic Wars; became a member of Parliament and a colonial administrator

- Classical economist, wrote with Ricardo, founding member of London’s Political Economy club
  - A fervent free-trader; argued for repeal of the Corn Laws
  - Came up with the term “territorial division of labor”
  - Arguably came up with principle of comparative advantage (3 years *before*, and *better than* Ricardo’s example)

- But later in 1840s, started having second thoughts?

1. The “terms of trade argument”
  - Reducing tariffs can harm a country’s terms of trade

2. In favor of the “principle of reciprocity” rather than unilateral free trade; what we now call .hi[strategic trade policy]
  - Goal: “to adopt, with all foreign powers, the principle of reciprocity”
  - Better to get countries to agree to reduce tariffs in unison
  - A single country reducing tariffs can hurt its terms of trade
  - thought that in the long run, this would lead to freer trade around the world
  - thought (correctly), that the British Empire had the influence to successfully engage in strategic trade policy

- Mill reasons that it is possible, but it depends on the elasticity of foreign supply for our imports
  - without using those words, as “price elasticity” has not been “discovered” yet

- Perfectly elastic foreign demand $\implies$ no terms of trade effect

- Non-perfectly elastic foreign demand $\implies$ a terms of trade effect

- Recall our discussion of a large vs. a small country putting a tariff on imports!

# The Torrens-Mill Theory

.pull-left[

- Developed two theories:

1. Under certain circumstances, lowering a (pre-existing) tariff can deteriorate a country’s terms of trade
2. A country lowering a tariff may suffer a net loss

- The first is clear, the second is speculative
  - would lowering a tariff lower TOT more than the gains from greater trade??

- List is *always* in favor of free trade in everything *except* manufactured goods

- Only thinks that large, powerful, temperate, advanced countries can extend their development by protecting manufacturing and industrializing

- Largely from his study of Britain and the United States as leading examples

- Sees the progress of great nations as a sequence from free trade to protectionism (for manufacturing), and then back to free trade

> “History teaches us how nations which have been endowed by Nature with all resources which are requisite for the attainment of the highest grade of wealth and power, may and must...modify their [commercial] systems according to the measure of their own progress: in the first stage, adopting free trade with more advanced nations as a means of raising themselves from a state of barbarism, and of making advances in agriculture; in the second stage, promoting the growth of manufactures, fisheries, navigation, and foreign trade by means of commercial restrictions; and in the last stage, after reaching the highest degree of wealth and power, by gradually reverting to the principle of free trade and of unrestricted competition in the home as well as in foreign markets.”

Indeed, it is more than probable that without her [highly protectionist] commercial policy England would never have attained to such a large measure of municipal and individual freedom as she now possesses, for such freedom is the daughter of industry and wealth.”

- List is only perhaps the most popular historical figure making what economists call the .hi[“infant industries argument”]

- Promote .hi-purple[import substitution]: specific key industries should receive special protection (via tariffs, quotas, subsidies etc.) that discourage competition (from more efficient foreign imports)

- Eventually, once the industry matures (is no longer in the “infant” stage), it can stand on its own and compete with the rest of the world, protection can be lifted

> “The only case in which, on mere principles of political economy, protecting duties can be defensible, is when they are imposed temporarily (especially in a young and rising nation) in hopes of naturalizing a foreign industry, in itself perfectly suitable to the circumstances of the country. The superiority of one country over another in a branch of production often arises only from having begun it sooner. There may be no inherent advantage on one part, or disadvantage on the other, but only a present superiority of acquired skill and experience...But it cannot be expected that individuals should, at their own risk, or rather to their certain loss, introduce a new manufacture, and bear the burthen of carrying it on until the producers have been educated up to the level of those with whom the processes are traditional. A protecting duty, continued for a reasonable time, will sometimes be the least inconvenient mode in which the nation can tax itself for the support of such an experiment. But the protection should be confined to cases in which there is good ground of assurance that the industry which it fosters will after a time be able to dispense with it; nor should the domestic producers ever be allowed to expect that it will be continued to them beyond the time necessary for a fair trial of what they are accomplishing.”

The fact that labor-scarce, land-abundant countries  had a high potential for growth and also tended to impose high revenue-generating tariffs confounds the inference that high tariffs were responsible for their strong economic per-formance during this period,” (p.165).
