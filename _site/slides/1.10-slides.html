# Other Tests of H-O Theory: Bowen et. al (1987)

- Strong version of H-O Theory is a poor predictor of exports/imports

- Weaker versions do much better - is a country relatively more abundant in a factor than the world average? 
  - **Sign test**: does a country export goods that are more-intensive in the factor that they have relatively more than the world average? 
  - About 60% of the time: yes

# Other Tests of H-O Theory: Bowen et. al (1987)

- **Rank test**: rank countries based on relative abundance of factors (e.g. rank countries based on Labor, on Capital, etc)
  - Does that country also rank similarly in terms of exports of those factor-intensive goods 

- Doesn't predict very well! 
  - e.g. a country ranking high in labor abundance might be exporting more capital intensive goods than expected!

  - e.g. barely any trade in “net factor content”!

# Institutions or Transaction Costs?

.pull-left[

- Perhaps these deviations from H-O Theory are really asking the question:
&gt; “Why are transaction costs so high to prevent mutually beneficial trades?”

- However, comparing exports of labor-abundant nations in the Third world with the exports of capital-abundant nations do fit the theory quite well

- Also, changing comparative advantage over time is also reflected well
