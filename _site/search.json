In my experience, and having used different textbooks in the past, is that it is easier if I build more slowly to the full model. This class will be a “simplified Ricardian model” (there is a bit of fudging with marginal products vs. “required labor”) that gets you to see some of the essentials before we layer on additional parts in next class on the “standard” or “neoclassical” trade model.\nSo if you are reading the textbook, it won’t exactly match up to class for 1-2 weeks 😕"

    "section": "Appendix: Translating Between Textbook and Class",
    "text": "Appendix: Translating Between Textbook and Class\nFeenstra and Taylor take an approach that focuses on the marginal product of labor for producing each good. Recall from microeconomics that the marginal product of labor is how much additional output will be produced from adding one more (marginal) worker (or “unit of labor”). In the Ricardian model, the marginal product of labor is assumed to be a constant number, but different for each industry (and across countries). To solve a Ricardian model in this fashion, we need to be told the total supply of workers for each country \\((L, L')\\), as well as the marginal product of labor in each industry \\((MPL_x, MPL_y; MPL'_x, MPL'_y)\\), for each country.\n\nMarginal Products of Labor\nIn class, we used the total supply of labor in each country and the labor required to make 1 unit of each good in each country. \\((l_x, l_y; l'_x, l'_y)\\).\nThere is actually an easy clear relationship between these two approaches. The marginal product of labor for each good and the labor required to produce 1 unit of the good are inversely related:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nMPL_x &= \\frac{1}{l_x}\\\\\nMPL_y &= \\frac{1}{l_y}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThis should make sense. If for example, the marginal product of labor in producing \\(x\\) is \\(MPL_x = 4\\), this means that one worker can produce 4 units of \\(x\\). In order to produce 1 unit of \\(x\\), you only need \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) workers.\nFrom here, you can build the PPF equation (which, by the way, they do not do in the book!) as follows:\n\\[L = \\frac{x}{MPL_x}+\\frac{y}{MPL_y}\\]\nThis appears less intuitive, but it makes sense. The amount of \\(x\\) a country makes divided by the amount of \\(x\\) one worker can make gives the total labor allocation (labor demand) in the \\(x\\) industry. Do the same for \\(y\\), and add them together, and you are using the total labor supply \\(L\\).\n\n\nPPFs\nFrom here, you can solve for \\(y\\) to graph:\n\\[y = L * MPL_y - \\frac{MPL_y}{MPL_x} x\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gives you a \\(y\\)-intercept of \\(MPL_y * L\\), which again should make sense: the most amount of \\(y\\) a country could produce, it it only produced \\(y\\), is the total labor supply times the amount of \\(y\\) each worker can produce.\nThe slope, however, is very different from what we got \\(\\left(-\\frac{l_x}{l_y}\\right)\\), here it is \\(\\left(-\\frac{MPL_y}{MPL_x}\\right)\\), notice the \\(y\\) term is over the \\(x\\) term. This is less intuitive than our approach, but it will fundamentally give you the same answer!\n\\[\\frac{MPL_y}{MPL_x} = \\cfrac{\\left(\\frac{1}{l_y}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{1}{l_x}\\right)} = \\frac{l_x}{l_y}\\]\nAs an example, let’s take:\nFor Home:\n\n\\(L=100\\)\n\\(MPL_x = 1\\)\n\\(MPL_y = 0.5\\)\n\nFor Foreign:\n\n\\(L'=100\\)\n\\(MPL_x = 1\\)\n\\(MPL_y = 0.25\\)\n\nHome’s PPF:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nL&=\\frac{x}{MPL_x}+\\frac{y}{MPL_y}\\\\\n100&=\\frac{x}{1}+\\frac{y}{0.5}\\\\\n100&=x+2y\\\\\n50-0.5x &= y\\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nForeign’s PPF:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nL'&=\\frac{x}{MPL_x'}+\\frac{y}{MPL_y'}\\\\\n100&=\\frac{x}{1}+\\frac{y}{0.25}\\\\\n100&=x+4y\\\\\n25-0.25x &= y\\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWhich was the same as our PPFs in class!\n\n\nAbsolute Advantage\nIn Feenstra & Taylor’s method, whichever country has a higher marginal product of labor has an absolute advantage in the production of that good.\n\n\n\n\n\\(MPL_x\\)\n\\(MPL_y\\)\n\n\n\n\nHome\n1\n0.5\n\n\nForeign\n1\n0.25\n\n\n\nHere, neither Home nor Foreign has an absolute advantage in producing \\(x\\), since they both have the same labor productivity. Home, however, has an absolute advantage in producing \\(y\\), since it has a higher marginal product of labor in producing \\(y\\).\nCompare to what we did in class, indicating absolute advantage by whomever requires fewer workers to produce a single unit of each good:\n\n\n\n\n\\(l_x\\)\n\\(l_y\\)\n\n\n\n\nHome\n1\n2\n\n\nForeign\n1\n4\n\n\n\nWhile the numbers will be inverses of the ones from the table above (because marginal product of labor is the inverse of the number of workers required per unit of the good), we still get the same result, because it requires fewer workers in Home to produce \\(y\\) (2) than Foreign (4).\n\n\nComparative Advantage\nComparative advantage proceeds the same for both methods: estimate the opportunity cost of producing each good in each country, and the country that has a lower opportunity cost in a particular good has the comparative advantage in producing that good."

How do they fix them?\nHow do these institutions appear, change, and/or disappear over time? (There are economic reasons!)\nAre cartels always economically harmful?\nHow are these same problems present today?\nWere monopolies, guilds, and other mercantilist restrictions all as bad as we economists often say they are?\n\n\n\nDiscussion Board\nStarting next week, we will occasionally have a weekly discussion board open on Blackboard. (Not every week. I will let you know when we have one open at the beginning of each week.) You will be expected to contribute to the discussion board at least twice by Sunday night. Your weekly contribution will be graded out of 5 points. At the end of the semester, I will apply the average of your weekly participation grades to apply (20%) towards your final course grade.\nI am interested in your thoughts, reactions, comments, and questions about any of the material (lectures and/or readings). You do not need to write more than a paragraph. Anything more than that, including continuing to reply to each others’ thoughts, questions, or comments, (which I strongly hope you do!) is solely based on your own interest and curiosity. I will jump in to answer questions the group is stuck on, give my two cents, and stir the pot as needed. I strontly hope we still keep a conversation going and can learn from each other, that was always my goal, not to lecture at you!"

The first is serious, the second is hilarious:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions To Help Your Reading\n\nWhat are the policy prescriptions of the mercantilists?\nWhat aspects of mercantilism are still present today?\nWhat does modern economics think of mercantilist ideas?\nWhat are the legacies of colonialism and European imperialism?\nHow did European colonists decide what kind of colony to set up (inclusive or extractive, to use Acemolgu & Robinson’s terms)?\nMost (if not all) of the inclusive colonies tended to be British. Is that an important factor?\n\nMercantilism as a coherent philosophy is archaic today. But how are some of its economic tenets (e.g. positive trade surplus) practiced or believed today?\nIn what ways are today’s developing countries mercantilist? In what ways are they NWW’s natural states?\nAdam Smith, Bastiat, and the Classical Economists ridiculed Mercantilism to a pulp, such that no serious economist today supports mercantilist ideas about trade. But how should we view Mercantilism in the context of its time?\nEnding mercantilism is simple, in theory - get rid of trade barriers, monopoly privileges, and other restrictions. Why is it so hard? And in particular, should we encourage developing countries to do this?"

    "section": " Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nToday, we continue looking at an intellectual history of trade, discussing new protectionist arguments that emerged since the decline of mercantilism.\nIt has probably been drilled in your head by economists that tariffs are bad (and I am happy to be only the latest professor doing it!). The overwhelming majority of economists agree that tariffs, in the practical, political, real world are not a net gain. The most sober-minded and non-ideological of them recognize that there are theoretical conditions where tariffs can be good for an economy - though identifying those conditions in the complexity of the real world is difficult.\nI want to give the protectionists their due, and to that end, in this discussion (and the following one, on industrial policy), I want to push you all to confront two possibilities and grapple with them:\n\nThere are conditions, however theoretical, where tariffs (or other trade restrictions, and not free trade) might be good.\nHistorically, the wealthy developed countries (e.g. Britain and the United States), while touting the ideology of free trade, were themselves quite protectionist for a long time.\n\nThe opponents of free trade have latched onto these facts historically (and today), and have historically made arguments that are a variation of: the U.S./U.K. became the wealthiest countries in the world BECAUSE of their tariffs, particularly in the 19th century. This has been a significant intellectual argument among certain elements of the economic nationalist right in this country, and this was well before President Trump arrived on the scene! Later, I will trace this argument from Alexander Hamilton in the 1790s through Friedrich List and Henry Clay in the 1830s to Pat Buchanan in the 1990s. I want us to grapple with this argument, and we will do so again in our following discussion on industrial policy (they are all related)."

    "text": "Optimization\nFor most curves, we often want to find the value where the function reaches its maximum or minimum (in general, these are types of “extrema”) along some interval\n\n\n\n\n\nFormally, a function reaches a maximum at \\(x^*\\) if \\(f(x^*) \\geq f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\); or a minimum at \\(x^*\\) if \\(f(x^*) \\leq f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) - In the graph above, the function reaches a maximum at \\(x_1\\) and a minimum at \\(x_2\\)\nThe maximum or minimum of a function occurs where the slope (first derivative) is zero, known in calculus as the “first-order condition” \\[\\frac{df(x^*)}{dx} = 0\\]\n\nTo distinguish between maxima and minima, we have the “second-order condition”\n\nA minimum occurs when the second derivative of the function is positive, and the curve is convex \\[\\frac{d^2f(x^*)}{dx^2} > 0\\]\nA maximum occurs when the second derivative of the function is negative, and the curve is concave \\[\\frac{d^2f(x^*)}{dx^2} < 0\\]\nAn inflection point occurs where the second derivative of the function is zero\nAll three are known as “critical points”\n\n\nThis is often useful for unconstrained optimization, e.g. finding the quantity of output that maximizes profits\nNote, if we have a multivariate function \\(y=f(x_1, x_2)\\) and want to find the maximum or minimum (\\(x_1^\\star, x_2^\\star\\)), the first order conditions (FOC, plural) are where all the partial derivatives (derivative with respect to \\(x_1\\) and derivative with respect to \\(x_2\\)) are zero \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial f(x_1^*, x_2^*)}{\\partial x_1} &= 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f(x_1^*, x_2^*)}{\\partial x_2} &= 0 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\] There are second order conditions as well, to demonstrate whether an extremum is a maximum or minimum, but they are too complex to discuss here.\nOften we want to find the maximum or minimum of a function over some restricted values of \\((x_1, x_2)\\), known as constrained optimization. This is one of the most important modeling tools in microeconomics, and will show up in many contexts.\n\nWe want to find the maximum of some function:\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\max_{x_1, x_2} f(x_1, x_2)\\\\\n\\text{subject to } g(x_1, x_2)=c \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\\(f(x_1, x_2)\\) is the “objective function” we wish to maximize (or minimize)\n\\(g(x_1, x_2)=c\\) is the “constraint” that limits us within some specified set of \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) values\n\nMuch of microeconomic modeling is about figuring out what an agent’s objective is (e.g. maximize profits, maximize utility, minimize costs) and what their constraints are (e.g. budget, time, output).\nThere are several ways to solve a constrained optimization problem (see Appendix to Ch. 5 in textbook), the most frequent (but requiring calculus) is Lagrangian multiplier method.\nGraphically, the solution to a constrained optimization problem is the point where a curve (objective function) and a line (constraint) are tangent to one another: they just touch, but do not intersect (e.g. at point A below).\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the point of tangency (A), the slope of the curve (objective function) is equal to the slope of the line (constraint)\n\nThis is extremely useful and is always the solution to simple constrained optimization problems, e.g.\n\ne.g. maximizing utility subject to income\ne.g. minimizing cost subject to a certain level of output\n\nWe can find the equation of the tangent line using point slope form \\[y-y_1=m(x-x_1)\\]\nWe need to know the slope \\(m\\), which we would know from the slope of the function at that point\nWe know \\((x_1, y_1\\)) is the point of tangency"

Economics deals with society’s fundamental problems; it concerns everyone and belongs to all. It is the main and proper study of every citizen.”\n\n — Ludwig von Mises\n\n“The task of the economist is not to plan utopias, but to criticize reality”\n\n — Joan Robinson\n\n“The first lesson of economics is scarcity: There is never enough of anything to satisfy all those who want it. The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics.”\n\n — Thomas Sowell\n\n“The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back. I am sure that the power of vested interests is vastly exaggerated compared with the gradual encroachment of ideas.”\n\n — John Maynard Keynes\n\n“There are no solutions, there are only tradeoffs.”\n\n — Thomas Sowell\n\n“The problem is that most of what a student is likely to read or hear about international economics is nonsense.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Take notes. On paper. Yes. Studies show that using pen and paper trump taking notes on a device. The main reason is because you cannot possibly write down everything I am saying by hand. This forces you to selectively filter my lecture to its most essential and important components – an integral part of the learning and retention process. If you are taking notes on a laptop, you become a court stenographer, thoughtlessly transcribing everything I am saying. At the other extreme, do not assume everything is written in my lecture slides. My lecture slides are visuals and cues to organize the content both for me and for you. I try hard to make sure that I have few words on slides, and even fewer answers to problems.\n\nMy suggestion: print out my lecture slides in advance (or follow along on your device) and take additional notes by hand.\n\nAt least skim all of the readings. I give out readings for a reason, and that reason is not to bore you or waste your time. The truth is, as a beginner, you can’t rely on heuristics or memory to “fill in the blanks.” You need the readings to provide context to what I am saying in class. I cannot help you if you are not going to try. Any professor also will lose patience at short notice when it’s discovered you haven’t done the reading.\nDo the homeworks (if there are any). You might be surprised that I need to say this, but I do. Students that do not do the homeworks do poorly on exams, which often are similar to homework questions. Homeworks are the best practice for exams, they give you a sense of the relevant content areas that might come up, the type and style of questions that I ask, and you often get answer keys to help you “get inside my head” and study from. There is no good reason why you should have a low homework grade.\nWork on assignments together and study together. Recognize that you are not in this alone, and other students are just as anxious or uncertain as you are. More surprisingly, other students probably have some answers you are looking for, and you may have answers for some of their problems! You will learn better when you collaborate with others similar to you. More importantly, you don’t truly understand something unless you can explain it to others.1 As a wise woman once told me “whomever is doing the talking is doing the learning.”\nLearn how to learn. The most important skill you learn in college is how to learn. Taking a course on a subject will not make you an expert on that subject. It a) helps you recognize that you do not know everything on that subject, and this prevents you from actively saying stupid things; and b) gives you enough context and skills to figure out how to actually fill those gaps. This is the actual skill that’s relevant in the real world.2\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nYes, that means I am doing a ton of learning every time I teach!↩︎\nYes, Google is your best friend. But you do not yet know how to ask the right questions, or understand what constitutes good answers.↩︎"

However, this simple concept is both remarkably complex economically, and is a vital ingredient for human civilization to flourish. The biggest difference between the last 250 (or so) years and the entire remainder of human history is the dramatic scale by which we have extended the division of labor. The overwhelming majority of our ancestors mired in what we would today consider abject poverty (for them it was the norm), rarely ever travelled more than a few miles from their birthplace, and to obtain just the basic goods needed for human subsistence–food, clothing, shelter, medicine–they had to make these themselves. Today, each of us consumes a wealth of goods which requires millions of tasks to be performed by people across the globe that we will never meet, and each of us will contribute only a sliver of tasks required to produce wealth to be enjoyed by people across the world we will never meet.\nIn this course, we will look at trade from this broad framework of extending the division of labor for human betterment. At the same time, we will get into the weeds and survey theories (and evidence) for understanding international trade flows and foreign trade policy: the purposes for its existence, the gains (and costs) created, and the division of those gains among different groups. As these subjects often intersect with current geopolitical events, especially during election cycles, we will attempt to explain these events using economic theory. Nearly all international trade theories are extensions of basic microeconomics, so this class assumes you have met the required prerequisite courses: ECON 205, 206, and 306.\nThis course will be a hybrid of formal lecture, readings-based class discussions, with exams and a presentation serving as the prime means of evaluation.\nI reserve the right to change any part of this syllabus and course, at my discretion, with proper advance warning."

    "text": "Accessibility, Equity, and Accommodations\nCollege courses can, and should, be challenging and bring you out of your comfort zone in a safe and equitable environment. If, however, you feel at any point in the semester that certain assignments or aspects of the course will be disproportionately uncomfortable or burdensome for you due to any factor beyond your control, please come see me or email me. I am a very understanding person and am happy to work out a solution together. I reserve the right to modify and reweight assignments at my sole discretion for students that I belive would legitimately be at a disadvantage, through no fault of their own, to complete them as described.\nIf you are unable to afford required textbooks or other resources for any reason, come see me and we can find a solution that works for you.\nThis course is intended to be accessible for all students, including those with mental, physical, or cognitive disabilities, illness, injuries, impairments, or any other condition that tends to negatively affect one’s equal access to education. If at any point in the term, you find yourself not able to fully access the space, content, and experience of this course, you are welcome to contact me to discuss your specific needs. I also encourage you to contact the Office of Accessibility Services (301-696-3421). If you have a diagnosis or history of accommodations in high school or previous postsecondary institutions, Accessibility Services can help you document your needs and create an accommodation plan. By making a plan through Accessibility Services, you can ensure appropriate accommodations without disclosing your condition or diagnosis to course instructors."
