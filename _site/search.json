In my experience, and having used different textbooks in the past, is that it is easier if I build more slowly to the full model. This class will be a “simplified Ricardian model” (there is a bit of fudging with marginal products vs. “required labor”) that gets you to see some of the essentials before we layer on additional parts in next class on the “standard” or “neoclassical” trade model.\nSo if you are reading the textbook, it won’t exactly match up to class for 1-2 weeks 😕"

    "text": "Take notes. On paper. Yes. Studies show that using pen and paper trump taking notes on a device. The main reason is because you cannot possibly write down everything I am saying by hand. This forces you to selectively filter my lecture to its most essential and important components – an integral part of the learning and retention process. If you are taking notes on a laptop, you become a court stenographer, thoughtlessly transcribing everything I am saying. At the other extreme, do not assume everything is written in my lecture slides. My lecture slides are visuals and cues to organize the content both for me and for you. I try hard to make sure that I have few words on slides, and even fewer answers to problems.\n\nMy suggestion: print out my lecture slides in advance (or follow along on your device) and take additional notes by hand.\n\nAt least skim all of the readings. I give out readings for a reason, and that reason is not to bore you or waste your time. The truth is, as a beginner, you can’t rely on heuristics or memory to “fill in the blanks.” You need the readings to provide context to what I am saying in class. I cannot help you if you are not going to try. Any professor also will lose patience at short notice when it’s discovered you haven’t done the reading.\nDo the homeworks (if there are any). You might be surprised that I need to say this, but I do. Students that do not do the homeworks do poorly on exams, which often are similar to homework questions. Homeworks are the best practice for exams, they give you a sense of the relevant content areas that might come up, the type and style of questions that I ask, and you often get answer keys to help you “get inside my head” and study from. There is no good reason why you should have a low homework grade.\nWork on assignments together and study together. Recognize that you are not in this alone, and other students are just as anxious or uncertain as you are. More surprisingly, other students probably have some answers you are looking for, and you may have answers for some of their problems! You will learn better when you collaborate with others similar to you. More importantly, you don’t truly understand something unless you can explain it to others.1 As a wise woman once told me “whomever is doing the talking is doing the learning.”\nLearn how to learn. The most important skill you learn in college is how to learn. Taking a course on a subject will not make you an expert on that subject. It a) helps you recognize that you do not know everything on that subject, and this prevents you from actively saying stupid things; and b) gives you enough context and skills to figure out how to actually fill those gaps. This is the actual skill that’s relevant in the real world.2\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nYes, that means I am doing a ton of learning every time I teach!↩︎\nYes, Google is your best friend. But you do not yet know how to ask the right questions, or understand what constitutes good answers.↩︎"

However, this simple concept is both remarkably complex economically, and is a vital ingredient for human civilization to flourish. The biggest difference between the last 250 (or so) years and the entire remainder of human history is the dramatic scale by which we have extended the division of labor. The overwhelming majority of our ancestors mired in what we would today consider abject poverty (for them it was the norm), rarely ever travelled more than a few miles from their birthplace, and to obtain just the basic goods needed for human subsistence–food, clothing, shelter, medicine–they had to make these themselves. Today, each of us consumes a wealth of goods which requires millions of tasks to be performed by people across the globe that we will never meet, and each of us will contribute only a sliver of tasks required to produce wealth to be enjoyed by people across the world we will never meet.\nIn this course, we will look at trade from this broad framework of extending the division of labor for human betterment. At the same time, we will get into the weeds and survey theories (and evidence) for understanding international trade flows and foreign trade policy: the purposes for its existence, the gains (and costs) created, and the division of those gains among different groups. As these subjects often intersect with current geopolitical events, especially during election cycles, we will attempt to explain these events using economic theory. Nearly all international trade theories are extensions of basic microeconomics, so this class assumes you have met the required prerequisite courses: ECON 205, 206, and 306.\nThis course will be a hybrid of formal lecture, readings-based class discussions, with exams and a presentation serving as the prime means of evaluation.\nI reserve the right to change any part of this syllabus and course, at my discretion, with proper advance warning."

Some assignments may require in-class participation for credit, and an (unexcused) absence may be detrimental to your grade. Attending class is one of the strongest predictors of success.\nIf you know you will be absent, you are not required to let me know, but it is polite to give notice (Note if I do not reply to an email of yours letting me know, I am probably busy but will still see it and appreciate your email). Your absence will be noted and recorded for the purposes stated above. If, however, we have an assignment due in class, you must notify me ahead of time in order to make alternate arrangements to still receive credit. Hasty ex-post attempts to notify me will generate little sympathy."

Even if it is the last week of the semester, I encourage you to turn in late work: some points are better than no points!\nHomeworks: If you turn in a homework after it is due but before it is graded or the answer key posted, I generally will not take off any points. However, if you turn in a homework after the answer key is posted, I will automatically deduct 20 points (so the maximum grade you can earn on it is an 80).\nExams: If you know that you will be unable to complete an in-class exam as scheduled for a legitimate reason, please notify me at least one week in advance, and we will schedule a make-up exam date. Failure to do so, including desperate attempts to make arrangements only after the exam will result in a grade of 0 and little sympathy.\nI reserve the right to re-weight assignments for students whom I believe are legitimately unable to complete a particular assignment."

Written communications, like blog posts or use of the Zoom chat, lacks important nonverbal cues (such as body language, tone of voice, sarcasm, etc).\nAbove all else, please respect one another and think/reread carefully about how others may see your post before you submit a comment. You are expected to disagree and have different opinions, this is inherently valuable in a discussion. Please be civil and constructive in responding to others’ comments: writing “have you considered ‘X’?” is a lot more helpful to all involved than just writing “well you’re just wrong.”\nPosting content that is wilfully incindiary, illegal, or that constitutes academic dishonesty (such as plagarism) will automatically earn a grade of 0 and may be elevated to other authorities on campus.\nWhen using the chat function on Zoom or public Slack channels, please treat it as official course communications, even though I may not be grading it. It may be a quick and informal tool - don’t feel you need to worry about spelling or perfect grammar - but please try to avoid too informal “text-speak” (i.e. say “That’s good for you” instead of “thas good 4 u”)."
