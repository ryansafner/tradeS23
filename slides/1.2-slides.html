&gt; “The woollen coat, for example, which covers the day-labourer, as coarse and rough as it may appear, is the produce of the joint labour of a great multitude of workmen. The shepherd, the sorter of the wool, the wool-comber or carder, the dyer, the scribbler, the spinner, the weaver, the fuller, the dresser, with many others, must all join their different arts in order to complete even this homely production. How many merchants and carriers, besides, must have been employed in transporting the materials from some of those workmen to others who often live in a very distant part of the country! how much commerce and navigation in particular, how many ship-builders, sailors, sail-makers, rope-makers, must have been employed in order to bring together [resources] from the remotest corners of the world!...If we examine, I say, all these things, and consider what a variety of labour is employed about each of them, we shall be sensible that without .hi[the assistance and co-operation of many thousands], the very meanest person in a civilized country could not be provided, even according to what we very falsely imagine, the easy and simple manner in which he is commonly accommodated.” (Book I, Chapter 1).

Let me say that again, because it is so obvious it's confusing. .hi[As the number of potential customers you can reach expands, and the costs of shipping and handling fall, factories become fewer and larger.] There is far more capital investment in these factories, but fewer workers.

&gt; "Today, most pin manufacture has moved to Asia. Your first impulse might be to nod and think, ``Sure, cheap labor.'' But that is not an important part of the story. Pin manufacturing is highly capital intensive. Smith's insight on the division of labor, and Howe's idea of making the process continuous and making labor more productive, have combined to expand the market for Chinese pins to the whole world. The number of workers engaged in pin manufacture in China has \emph{fallen}, not risen, as pin output has expanded. And wages have increased more than ten-fold, as productivity has exploded"
