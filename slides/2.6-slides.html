- Princeton economist that argued comparative advantage is not an “infallable principle” for commercial policy

- Argued that some industries might warrant *permanent* protection
  - recall infant industries argument is just about *temporary* protection

- Main argument hinges on .hi[increasing returns to scale] (decreasing cost industry)

- If manufacturing has increasing returns to scale:

&gt; “protection to manufactures may advantageously be continued much longer than would seem adequate to cover the infant stage, whether or not the industry could maintain itself without such aid,” (p.200).

&gt; “[I]t may be to a country’s economic advantage to protect an industry which could not grow up or survive without protection and which never will be able to survive without it, an industry which has no comparative advantage when the protective duty is first levied nor ever attains one under it,” (pp.202-203).

- Counter against Graham’s “ingenious” but “fallacious” argument

- Took major issue with a footnote in Graham:

&gt; “The reasoning in the text simply assumes that a decreasing [average] cost is obtained by an expansion of the production of [manufacturing]; whether the cause of it be external or internal economies is immaterial to the theory, though it would, of course, affect the degree of its applicability,” (p.204n).

- It turns out it makes all the difference whether we are talking about internal economies of scale or external economies of scale!

- Knight: increasing returns *internal* to the firm are not compatible with competition
  - if a single firm has significant economies of scale, it would serve the entire industry and become a monopoly!

&gt; “If competition is effective, the size of the production unit will tend to grow until *either* no further economies are obtainable, *or* there is only one establishment left and the idnustry is a monopoly...When all establishments have been brought to the efficient size, variation in total output is a matter of changing their *number*, in which no technical economies are involved...an increase in the output of a commodity must increase its cost of production unless the industry is, or becomes, a monopoly,” (p.597)

- New entrants would bid factors of production away from established firms, raise their price, or use lesser quality 

&gt; “These inevitable sources of increasing cost must be more than offset by some kind of purely ‘external’ economies in organization. In spite of the weight of authority which may be cited for such economies [i.e. Marshall], I have never succeeded in picturing in them in my mind, or finding any convincing reason to believe they exist; and the hypothetical examples cited by Professor Graham...has not assisted me in doing so. I cannot believe such conditions general enough to justify a special law in economic theory, or a special provision in tariff legislation,” (p.331).

&gt; “These extraordinary results are the consequence, and wholly the consequence, of value-theory reasoning, implicit or explicit in Graham's argument, which is either unambiguously erroneous or is of very limited practical significance,” (p.478).

- Implications of trade policies depend on whether external economies depend on *domestic* output or *world* output (to lower all firms’ costs)
  - If world output, would not matter much if domestic firms reduced their output (other foreign firms would expand), domestic firms would still get the benefit of external economies (from foreign firms)

&gt; “A concievable case for protection on the basis of the existence of external economies in an industry which from the individual producer’s point of view is at a comparative disadvantage in costs can be made out, therefore, only where these external economies are (a) dependent on the size of the national and not the world industry and (b) are technological rather than pecuniary, or if pecuniary, are not at the expense of domestic sellers or services or materials to the industry. The scope for application of the argument is extremely limited, especially as it seems difficult even to suggest plausible hypothetical cases of the existence of genuine technological external economies...[Graham’s increasing returns argument for protectionism is] little more than a theoretical curiosity” (pp.480-481).

- Economies of scale come in two flavors:

- .hi-purple[*Internal* economies]: firm-level features that improve a **firm's** productivity, often leading to market power for that firm 
  - e.g. firm produces more and lowers its average costs

- .hi-purple[*External* economies]: industry-wide features that spill over to the productivity **all** firms in the industry

&gt; "If all inputs were paid their value marginal product, the firm would suffer losses," (p.S76).

&gt; "There is little doubt that much of the value to society of any given innovation or discovery is not captured by the inventor, and any model that missed these spillovers would miss important elements of the growth process. Yet it is still the case that private, profit-maximizing agents make investments in the creation of new knowledge and that they earn a return on these investments by charging a price for the resulting goods that is greater than the marginal cost of producing the goods," (p.S90).

# Romer Model Implication I - R&amp;D Is Critical

.smallest[
- Economies tend to undersupply human capital to research:
]

.quitesmall[
&gt; The most obvious reason is that research has positive external effects. An additional design raises the productivity of all future individuals who do research, but because this benefit is nonexcludable, it is not reflected at all in the market price for designs. The second and an equally important reason...is that research produces an input that is purchased by a sector that engages in monopoly pricing. The markup of price over marginal cost forces a wedge between the marginal social product of an input used in this sector and its market compensation," (p.S96)

- Policy implications:

.quitesmall[
&gt; "Within the confines of the model, the social optimum can be achieved by subsidizing the accumulation of A," (p.S97)

&gt; "A subsidy to physical capital accumulation may be a very poor substitute for direct subsidies that increase the incentive to undertake research. In the absence of feasible policies that can remove the divergence between the social and private returns to research, a second-best policy would be to subsidize the accumulation of total human capital," (p.S99)

# Romer Model Implication II - Trade Liberalization

.smallest[
- A large population is *not* sufficient for greater technology (and thus, economic growth), it requires access to a *larger market* (division of labor)!
]

.quitesmall[
&gt; If access to a large number of workers or consumers were all that mattered, having a large population would be a good substitute for trade with other nations. The model here suggests that what is important for growth is integration not into an economy with a large number of people but rather into one with a large amount of human capital, (p.S98)

&gt; "The most interesting positive implication of the model is that an economy with a larger total stock of human capital will experience faster growth. This finding suggests that free international trade can act to speed up growth. It also suggests a way to understand what it is about developed economies in the twentieth century that permitted rates of growth of income per capita that are unprecedented in human history. The model also suggests that low levels of human capital may help explain why growth is not observed in underdeveloped economies that are closed and why a less developed economy with a very large population can still benefit from economic integration with the rest of the world," (p.S99)

&gt; President Trump made good on his 2016 campaign pledge to the steel industry, slapping 25% tariffs on foreign-made steel...

&gt; The tariffs succeeded in pushing down steel imports and—for a short time—resulted in higher prices for domestic steelmakers...

&gt; Yet the tariffs haven’t produced the steelmaking renaissance and robust job growth in America’s industrial heartland that Mr. Trump promised. What’s more, the tariffs have hurt U.S. manufacturers, including those in the automotive and appliance sectors, who say the duties on steel and aluminum continue to keep their metal costs higher than what overseas competitors pay.

&gt; “The government picked winners and losers here,”...

&gt; With the expanded production, about 6,000 jobs were added to the U.S. steel industry’s workforce after tariffs started in 2018, according to the Census Bureau. By the end of 2019, though, those gains evaporated as steel demand and prices sank [but h]igher prices also made steel more expensive for manufacturers that buy it, leading to the loss of about 75,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs, according to a study released late last year by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.

&gt; U.S. President Donald Trump says China pays the tariffs he has imposed on $250 billion of Chinese exports to the United States. 

&gt; But that is not how tariffs work. China’s government and companies in China do not pay tariffs directly. Tariffs are a tax on imports. They are paid by U.S.-registered firms to U.S. customs for the goods they import into the United States.

&gt; Importers often pass the costs of tariffs on to customers - manufacturers and consumers in the United States - by raising their prices.
