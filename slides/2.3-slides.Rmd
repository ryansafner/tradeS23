- Now that we know the major models and tools of trade policy, we want to examine what are the best arguments for and against free trade

- To do this, we dive into the history of trade and the intellectual history of trade arguments

- We will examine and discuss (on the discussion board) some papers about the development of trading institutions

- Bring it up to modern arguments against free trade, industrial policy, and then politics

# The Economics of Sharecropping I

- Consider two individuals: 

1. Farmer
2. Landowner

- Farmer and Landowner must write a contract to agree on how to divide the surplus

- One extreme solution:

- Farmer pays a fixed fee up front, once paid, the farmer keeps all surplus

- Would have to be high enough to be worthwhile to the landlord

- Problems with this solution:
  1. requires high upfront cost to farmer (often poor, capital-constrained)
  2. imposes the entirety of the risk on the farmer (bad harvest, weather, invasion, theft)

- New .hi-purple[principle-agent problems] introduced:

1. Farmer has an incentive to *underreport* to landlord how much surplus they produce, effectively "stealing" more than their share
  - landowner must monitor farmer to reduce this possibility (and this is costly)

2. Farmer is effectively taxed (50%, in this example) on their output
  - has 50% less incentive to be productive than if they were 100% residual claimant
  - farmer will exert less effort since they get less of the output

- .hi[Rulers] (kings, queens, emperor, lords) face certain incentives:
  - Trade is an attractive source of wealth (along with plundering and warfare)
  - Rulers have a strong incentive to create trading cities: potential .hi-purple[tax revenue]

- Often granted cities and merchants privileges and exemptions from feudal duties
  - Medieval towns as first proto-capitalist centers of specialization and trade

- Trade requires peace & stable property rights

- Can trade exist with cours that are partial to **local** merchants over **foreign** merchants?
  - How can merchants be secure in their property and person?

# The Role of Medieval Guilds in *Promoting* Trade

- We often think of Medieval guilds as just monopolies or cartels meant to **restrict** trade
  - This is true

- But in a way they also **promoted** trade
  - Were set up by merchants to reduce transactions costs
  - Solved credible commitment problems for rulers

- Guilds were administrative bodies

- Ability to regulate trade within local region

- Guilds had chapters in each city, could gain access to all guild privileges abroad

- **Monitored** and provided **information** about merchant activity
  - Rulers (and merchants!) who cheated, broke promises, or were corrupt were widely publicized within guild

- Guilds allowed merchants to .hi-purple[coordinate collective action] in punishing transgressors

- A .hi-purple[free rider problem] in punishment:
  - individual merchant doesn’t have incentive to punish
  - may have reason to get a corrupt bargain at expense of other merchants!

- Violating merchants would have their privileges revoked, or be expelled from guild

- Untrustworthy rulers would be .hi-purple[boycotted] by entire guild across Europe
  - Even a case of the Hanseatic League *going to war*!
  - 1358 Hansa embargo of Bruges

> “It was announced that any disobedience, whether by a town or an individual, was to be punished by perpetual exclusion from the Hansa”

- Milgrom, North, and Weingast (1990) model these interactions as a multi-stage repeated game (p.11)

1. Traders may (at a cost $Q>0$) ask LM (publicly reports whether any trader has any unpaid judgments) about their current partner
2. Two traders play a prisoners' dilemma (*Honest* or *Cheat*)
3. If LM was asked before (in stage 1), either player may *Appeal* outcome to LM at a cost $C>0$
4. If *Appealed*, LM awards damages $(J)$ to Plaintiff if he was Honest and his partner Cheated; otherwise nothing 
5. Defendant chooses to *Pay* $J$ or *Not*
6. Unpaid judgments recorded by LM

- *International* merchants can't depend on weak and biased States to enforce *international* contracts!

- Merchants adopted their own "laws" and best practices to minimize transaction costs

- For-profit merchant courts emerge to settle disputes and enforce international contracts
  - More efficient, cheaper, and less partisan than Royal courts
  - Legal and jurisdictional competition

- Developed contract law and advanced legal instruments - debt, credit, loans, equity contracts

- This is a major basis of international commercial law today!
