Pin manufacturing is highly capital intensive. Smith's insight on the division of labor, and Howe's idea of making the process continuous and making labor more productive, have combined to expand the market for Chinese pins to the whole world. The number of workers engaged in pin manufacture in China has \emph{fallen}, not risen, as pin output has expanded. And wages have increased more than ten-fold, as productivity has exploded"
