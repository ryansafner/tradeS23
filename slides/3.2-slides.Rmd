- We‚Äôve really focused on the world of .hi[‚Äúneoliberalism‚Äù], the system of international trade institutions and underlying philosophy

  - I use ‚Äúneoliberalism‚Äù here as descriptive of the institutions and framework, not normative or moral

- Rightly or wrongly, people associate ‚Äúneoliberalism‚Äù with:
  - institutions: trade agreements, the WTO, the U.N., development policy
  - attitudes: free markets, cosmpolitanism, multilateralism, centrism, technocracy
  - politics/ideology: Ronald Regan, Margaret Thatcher, New Labor (Tony Blair, David Cameron), Milton Friedman

# Increasing Polarization: Two Tribes

- The culture war between two **tribes** (each are both normative and descriptive)

1. .hi[‚ÄúGlobal*ism*‚Äù]: urban, cosmopolitan, citizen of the world, tolerant of other cultures/religions/minorities, often elite professional

2. .hi[Populism/Nationalism]: rural, parochial, attached to local/national culture and identity, anxiety over economic obsolescence, anxiety over cultural/social change
  - Left-populism: critique of international capital exploiting working class
  - Right-populism: critique of globalist elite/foreigners exploiting ‚Äúthe little guy‚Äù/natives
  
- This does not *neatly* map to the divide between politically liberal/progressive and conservative
  - But it increasingly has been

# Fair Warning

- The average economist is both in favor of globalization and sympathizes with globalism
  - A lot of people think economists are more conservative than the public, but the average economist is a moderate Democrat 
- A lot of straw man arguments

- This conversation will not be easy, but is one our nation must have

Two centuries ago the world‚Äôs economy stood at the present level of Chad or Bangladesh. In those good old days of 1800...the average human consumed in modern-day prices...roughly $3 a day, give or take a dollar or two...The only people much better off than the $3 average were lords or bishops or some few of the merchants. It had been this way for all of history, and for that matter all of pre-history. With her $3, the typical denizen of the earth could eat a few pounds of potatoes, a little milk, very occasionally a scrap of meat. A wool shawl. A year or two of elementary education, if exceptionally lucky. At birth she had a 50-50 chance of dying before she was 30 years old. Perhaps she was a cheerful sort, and was "happy" with illiteracy, disease, superstition, periodic starvation, and lack of prospects. After all, she had her family and faith and community, which interfered with every choice she made. But anyway she was desperately poor, and narrowly limited in human scope. (pp. 11-12)

> [Today] the world supports more than six-and-a-half times more people...the average person today earns and consumes almost ten times more goods and services than in 1800. Real income per person in the world has recently been doubling every generation, and is accelerating. Starvation worldwide therefore is at an all-time low, and falling. Literacy and life expectancy are at all-time highs, and rising. Liberty is spreading. Slavery is retreating, as is a patriarchy enslaving of women. In the richer countries, such as Norway, the average person earns fully 45 times more than in 1800, a startling $137 a day. The environment - a concern of a well-to-do bourgeoisie - is in such rich places improving. (pp. 11-12)
