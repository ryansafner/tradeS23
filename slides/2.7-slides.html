  - Predict &amp; understand why and what countries trade (Trade Models)
  - Consequences of trade barriers (tariffs, quotas, subsidies, etc)
  - Intellectual history of free trade &amp; protectionist arguments
  
- **What’s Left**: for good or bad, **why** do countries have the trade policies they have today?

- If you agree with the following premises:
  1. Trade barriers are in general harmful and inefficient on net for a society
  2. Trade barriers *do* benefit specific groups of people
  
- We need to answer two questions:
  1. Why do trade barriers that are often inefficient and welfare-reducing *persist*? 
  2. How is it possible to get groups or countries to *agree to reduce* trade barriers?

- .hi[Bureaucrats] implement laws according to goals set by politicians

# Is Trade Policy For Sale?

.smallest[
&gt; “The bigger contributions you accept, the more expectations some people have that they have a call on their government for something in return” — Senator Joseph Liebermann, 1997

&gt; “Conventional wisdom suggests that interest groups are buying something when they contribute to a politician's campaign. mpaign. These interest groups must be giving money to influence either the outcome of the election or the policy decisions made by elected officials. Senator Lieberman's statement highlights the second possibility — that campaign contributions allow interest groups to affect policy outcome,” (p.80)

&gt; “This paper attempts to determine the importance of campaign contributions and other factors affecting voting behavior in the House of Representatives on three important trade-policy bills that came before the United States Congress in 1993-1994,” (p.80)

&gt; “Policies are determined by the interactions between elected officials, who are suppliers of particular public policies, and organized interest groups, who are demanders of such policies. Interest groups provide the campaign funds that public officials need to stress the merits of their candidacies to imperfectly informed voters. In exchange, politicians provide public policies that raise the economic rents earned by the interest groups. These rent-seeking activities are constrained by increased political opposition from individuals and firms whose welfare is reduced by the policy actions...In the end, government officials implement the policy that maximizes their political support,” (p.80)

&gt; “Two main trade models provide divergent predictions about which groups in the U.S. will support trade liberalization.

&gt; “In the Heckscher-Ohlin trade model, relatively scarce factors of production lose economically from international trade while relatively abundant factors gain...Since the United States is relatively scarce in less skilled labor, the model suggests that legislators will be more likely to oppose NAFTA, GATT and MFN for China the higher the proportion of less educated individuals and the lower the per-capita income in their districts. Because labor unions represent mainly blue-collar workers, a higher proportion of union members in a district also increases the likelihood the representative will oppose the trade bills.

&gt; “The [specific factors] trade model, on the other hand, assumes that the services of some productive factors are completely or partly industry-specific. A natural resource or particular type of physical capital may be suitable for use only in a single industry or a few industries, for example, and workers may acquire sector-specific skills. The implication is that individuals' attitudes toward trade liberalization depend on the industry in which they are employed rather than on their factor status,” (pp.80-81).

&gt; “We estimate that labor contributions or access to legislators gained through these contributions resulted in 67 extra votes against NAFTA and 57 extra votes against the GATT Uruguay Round bill. Contributions from business groups resulted in 41 extra votes in favor of NAFTA and 35 extra votes for the GATT bill. This last result is particularly interesting because it suggests that NAFTA would have failed if business groups had made no contributions to repres- entatives. We estimate the price for labor groups to sway one vote against NAFTA and GATT to be about $352,000 and $313,000 respectively,” (p.99).

# Trade Policy &amp; Interest Groups: Politicians For Sale?

“What is distinctive in our approach is the role we ascribe to political contributions: we see the gifts made by interest groups not so much as investments in the outcomes of elections, but more as a means to influence government policy. In our view, the manner of campaign and party finance in many democratic nations creates powerful incentives for politicians to peddle their policy influence. Then the structure of trade protection is bound to reflect the outcome of a competition for political favors; this is the central theme in our story,” (p.848)

# Trade Policy &amp; Interest Groups: Politicians For Sale?

“In our model, lobbies make implicit offers of political contributions as functions of the vector of trade policies (export and import taxes and subsidies) adopted by the government...We have derived an explicit formula for the structure of protection that emerges in such a setting. Our formula relates an industry's equilibrium protection to the state of its political organization, the ratio of domestic output in the industry to net [international] trade, and the elasticity of import demand or export supply,” (p.848).

# Who Gets Protected?

.pull-left[

- Less efficient, declining industries tend to obtain protection
  - Labor-intensive industries
  - Low-skill industries
  - Low-wage industries
  - Industries with high/increasing competition from imports
  - Industries that product consumer goods (as opposed to producer goods), especially where consumers are not organized (to oppose)

# Who Gets Protected: Agriculture

.pull-left[

.smallest[
1) Agriculture
  - About 2 million farmers in the U.S. (1.5% of the civilian labor force), yet very politically powerful
  - U.S. is largely a food **exporter**, so protection is not so much *(import) tariffs* but *(export) subsidies*
  - European Union's **Common Agricultural Policy** export subsidies boost farm prices 2-3x the world price
  - Japan's **import substitution** of rice: almost entirely bans imported rice, raising domestic prices to 5x the world price

# Who Gets Protected: Clothing

.pull-left[

.smallest[
2) Clothing: textiles &amp; apparel
  - Until 2005: Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA) set export and import quotas for many countries
  - Clothing is very labor-intensive
    - H-O theory `\(\implies\)` we should import clothing 
    - High-wage countries (like U.S.) have comparative *disadvantage* vs. developing countries with comparative *advantage*
    - U.S. clothing-manufacturers need protection to compete
