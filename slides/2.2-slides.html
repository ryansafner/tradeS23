# Non-Tariff Barriers

.pull-left[
.smaller[
- Tariffs are the most obvious trade barrier, literally and visibly raising the cost of traded goods

- More and more trade barriers today are not literal trade taxes (countries have committed to lowering tariffs)
  - costs of these other barriers are often hidden, but still are very real!
  - might there be political reasons for this? üßê

- In general, we call these .hi-purple[non-tariff barriers] to trade (NTBs)

# Import Quotas and Export Subsidies

.pull-left[
.smallest[

- We will examine two today:

- .hi[Import quota] places a quantitative limit on the number of imported units allowed
  - Developed countries usually restrict imported agriculture, developing countries usually restrict imported manufactured goods

- .hi[Export subsidy] is a subsidy (payment to encourage production) of exported goods
  - Both developed and developing countries do this to protect politically powerful groups (e.g. agriculture)

&gt; ‚ÄúIn many market-oriented economies, government restrictions upon economic activity are pervasive facts of life. These restrictions give rise to rents of a variety of forms, and people often compete for the rents. Sometimes, such competition is perfectly legal. In other instances, rent seeking takes other forms, such as bribery, corruption, smuggling, and black markets.‚Äù

&gt; ‚Äú.hi[When quantitative restrictions are imposed upon and effectively constrain imports, an import license is a valuable commodity]...It has always been recognized that there are some costs associated with licensing: paperwork, the time spent by entrepreneurs in obtaining their licenses, the cost of the administrative apparatus necessary to issue licenses, and so on. Here, the argument is carried one step further: .hi[in many circumstances resources are devoted to competing for those licenses],‚Äù (p.848).

- Japanese car manufacturers increasing share of the market with cheaper, more fuel-efficient cars

- U.S. and Japan negotiated a trade agreement that limited Japanese auto exports to the U.S. to 1.86 million in 1981, and to 1.85 million for 1984-1985 (failed to renew in 1985)

# Dumping

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Export subsidies are a form of .hi[‚Äúdumping‚Äù], where a country sells a good at a lower price in a foreign market than it charges at home
    - With an export subsidy, exporter can provide more exports at lower prices than if just selling domestically
    
- Goal is to gain market share in the foreign country and reduce foreign competition

- Similar to .hi[predatory pricing] in industrial organization between firms in a market (price below cost to drive out competitors) 

- Very hard to ‚Äúprove‚Äù
