- **What We've Learned**: 
  - Predict & understand why and what countries trade (Trade Models)
  - Consequences of trade barriers (tariffs, quotas, subsidies, etc)
  - Intellectual history of free trade & protectionist arguments
  
- **What's Left**: for good or bad, **why** do countries have the trade policies they have today? 
  - A theory of how politics interacts with economics: .hi[political economy]

- If you agree with the following premises:
  1. Trade barriers are on in general harmful and inefficient on net for a society
  2. Trade barriers *do* benefit specific groups of people
  
- We need to answer two questions:
  1. Why do trade barriers that are often inefficient and welfare-reducing *persist*? 
  2. How is it possible to get groups or countries to *agree to reduce* trade barriers?

> “[I]t may sometimes be a matter of deliberation [how to remove tariffs] when some foreign nation restrains by high duties or prohibitions the importation of some of our manufactures into their country. Revenge in this case naturally dictates retaliation, and that we should impose the like duties and prohibitions upon the importation of some or all of their manufactures into our country...nations accordingly seldom fail to retaliate in this manner.”

> “There may be a good policy in retaliations of this kind...The recovery of a great foreign market will generatlly more than compensate the transitory inconveniency of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods. To judge whether such retaliations are likely to produce such an effect...[belongs] to the skill of that insidious and crafty animal, vulgarly called the statesman or politician, whose councils are directed by the momentary fluctuations of affairs.”

> “[Reciprocity] would hold out to [foreign countries] a powerful inducement to act upon the principles of reciprocal freedom” - Torrens

> “[C]onsiderations of reciprocity...are of material importance when the repeal of duties...is discussed. A country cannot be expected to renounce the power of taxing foreigners, unless foreigners will in return practise towards itself the same forbearance. The only mode in which a country can save itself from being a loser by the duties imposed by other countries on its commodities, is to impose corresponding duties on theirs.” - Mill

# Finding Commitments: Bilateral Agreements

.quitesmall[
- .hi[Bilateral/multilateral trade agreements] provide .hi-purple[commitment strategies] for each nation to reduce tariffs

- Traditionally, it’s concentrated benefits to domestic importers who lobby politicians to put up tariffs

- With a trade agreement, domestic *exporters* (who *want* free access to foreign markets) act as a concentrated political force fighting to lower tariffs

- Creates *multiple* groups in *multiple* countries with vested interest in keeping trade open (tariffs down)

- More concentrated & strongly interested groups fighting *against* tariffs than *for* tariffs!
  - Less incentive for domestic politician to cater to protectionist interests

- Access to larger markets creates economies of scale

- More investment by outside countries to FTA-member countries (to take advantage of larger market) and avoid tariffs

# Effects of NAFTA

- Effects on U.S.: modest, increased GDP by 0.5%, or $80 billion

- Concentrated costs (U.S. manufacturing & automobiles) but dispersed benefits to consumers

- Est. 14 million jobs depend on trade with Canada and Mexico, 200,000 export related jobs created annually, paying 15-20% more on average than jobs lost to NAFTA

- Companies moving many factories to Mexico, U.S. auto sector lost 350,000 jobs since 1994; Mexican auto sector increased from 120,000 to 500,000 jobs

> “Studies by both the International Monetary Fund and the International Trade Commission conclude the revamped pact won’t meaningfully goose economic growth: The ITC projects it will raise GDP by 0.35 percent after six years; and the IMF says its broad effects will be “negligible.”

> “Indeed, economists say the agreement may be most important for what it prevents. Trump had threatened to pull the United States out of NAFTA if the three countries couldn’t reach a deal. That would have spelled a disastrous breakdown in cross-border commerce with the two most important U.S. trading partners. “At a time when slower global growth, rising protectionism, lingering policy uncertainty and a strong dollar are constraining activity, the deal prevents a negative impact worth 0.5% of GDP from a dissolution of Nafta,” Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Gregory Daco writes in a note to clients.”

> “The North-American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between Canada, Mexico, and the United States has been in force since January 1994. When NAFTA negotiations were concluded in 1992, it was the most comprehensive free trade agreement ever negotiated, creating the world’s largest market for goods and services. The agreement eliminated almost all tariffs between the three countries and incorporated numerous other innovative provisions. NAFTA influenced other free trade agreements that the United States later negotiated and multilateral negotiations. It also initiated a new generation of trade agreements in the Western Hemisphere and other parts of the world, influencing negotiations in areas such as market access, rules of origin, intellectual property rights, foreign investment, dispute resolution, worker rights, and environmental protection.”

Since the agreement came into effect, trade between the three NAFTA parties has increased from US$ 290 billion in 1993 to over US$ 1.1 trillion in 2017.”

> “Most economists agree that NAFTA has provided benefits to the North American economy by expanding trade and economic linkages between countries, creating more efficient production processes, increasing the availability of lower-priced consumer goods, and improving living standards. However, it has proven difficult to isolate the agreement’s beneficial effects from other factors, including rapid technological change, expanded trade with other countries such as China, and unrelated domestic developments in each of the countries. Debate also persists regarding NAFTA’s legacy on employment and wages, as some workers and industries have faced painful disruptions amid increased competition while others have gained from new market opportunities. This debate is evidenced in the fact that, after more than a quarter of a century, the impact of NAFTA remains a perennial topic of discussion in the broader debate over the benefits of free trade.”

Those culminated in a new trilateral United States – Mexico – Canada trade agreement (USMCA) signed by U.S. President Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau, and Mexican President Peña Nieto, on November 30, 2018...It includes tighter rules of origin in the automobile, textile, and apparel sectors, a new labor value content requirement in the auto sector, higher U.S. access to Canadian supply-managed markets, further goods trade facilitation, updated provisions related to financial services, as well as a new currency provision and a provision about entering free trade agreements with non-market economies.”

> “The conclusion of USMCA is occurring in a dynamic trade environment for Canada and Mexico. In March 2018, they joined 9 other countries in the Asia Pacific region in signing the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for a Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). This agreement will provide preferential access by Canada, Mexico, Japan and other CPTPP members to each other’s markets. Also, in May 2018, the United States imposed import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum due to national security concerns, to which U.S. major trade partners (including Canada and Mexico) responded with surtaxes on imports of selected U.S. products. Finally, in April and August 2018, the United States levied additional tariffs on a combined US$ 50 billion of imports from China, which immediately triggered retaliation by China. The impact of USMCA is analyzed within this context”

> “This paper uses a global, multisector, computable-general-equilibrium model to provide an analytical assessment of five key provisions in the new agreement, including tighter rules of origin in the automotive, textiles and apparel sectors, more liberalized agricultural trade, and other trade facilitation measures. The results show that together these provisions would adversely affect trade in the automotive, textiles and apparel sectors, while generating modest aggregate gains in terms of welfare, mostly driven by improved goods market access, with a negligible effect on real GDP. The welfare benefits from USMCA would be greatly enhanced with the elimination of U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico and the elimination of the Canadian and Mexican import surtaxes imposed after the U.S. tariffs were put in place.”
