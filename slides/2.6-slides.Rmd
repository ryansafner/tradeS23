- Princeton economist that argued comparative advantage is not an “infallable principle” for commercial policy

- Argued that some industries might warrant *permanent* protection
  - recall infant industries argument is just about *temporary* protection

- Main argument hinges on .hi[increasing returns to scale] (decreasing cost industry)

- Took major issue with a footnote in Graham:

> “The reasoning in the text simply assumes that a decreasing [average] cost is obtained by an expansion of the production of [manufacturing]; whether the cause of it be external or internal economies is immaterial to the theory, though it would, of course, affect the degree of its applicability,” (p.204n).

  - if a single firm has significant economies of scale, it would serve the entire industry and become a monopoly!

- Economies of scale come in two flavors:

- .hi-purple[*Internal* economies]: firm-level features that improve a **firm's** productivity, often leading to market power for that firm 
  - e.g. firm produces more and lowers its average costs

- .hi-purple[*External* economies]: industry-wide features that spill over to the productivity **all** firms in the industry

> The most obvious reason is that research has positive external effects. An additional design raises the productivity of all future individuals who do research, but because this benefit is nonexcludable, it is not reflected at all in the market price for designs. The second and an equally important reason...is that research produces an input that is purchased by a sector that engages in monopoly pricing. The markup of price over marginal cost forces a wedge between the marginal social product of an input used in this sector and its market compensation," (p.S96)

In the absence of feasible policies that can remove the divergence between the social and private returns to research, a second-best policy would be to subsidize the accumulation of total human capital," (p.S99)

# Romer Model Implication II - Trade Liberalization

.quitesmall[
> If access to a large number of workers or consumers were all that mattered, having a large population would be a good substitute for trade with other nations. The model here suggests that what is important for growth is integration not into an economy with a large number of people but rather into one with a large amount of human capital, (p.S98)

> "The most interesting positive implication of the model is that an economy with a larger total stock of human capital will experience faster growth. This finding suggests that free international trade can act to speed up growth. It also suggests a way to understand what it is about developed economies in the twentieth century that permitted rates of growth of income per capita that are unprecedented in human history. The model also suggests that low levels of human capital may help explain why growth is not observed in underdeveloped economies that are closed and why a less developed economy with a very large population can still benefit from economic integration with the rest of the world," (p.S99)

What I want to argue in this paper is that .hi[the most important thing to teach our undergrads about trade is how to detect that nonsense]. That is, our primary mission should be to vaccinate the minds of our undergraduates against the misconceptions that are so predominant in what passes for educated discussion about international trade.”

> The tariffs succeeded in pushing down steel imports and—for a short time—resulted in higher prices for domestic steelmakers...

> Yet the tariffs haven’t produced the steelmaking renaissance and robust job growth in America’s industrial heartland that Mr. Trump promised. What’s more, the tariffs have hurt U.S. manufacturers, including those in the automotive and appliance sectors, who say the duties on steel and aluminum continue to keep their metal costs higher than what overseas competitors pay.

> With the expanded production, about 6,000 jobs were added to the U.S. steel industry’s workforce after tariffs started in 2018, according to the Census Bureau. By the end of 2019, though, those gains evaporated as steel demand and prices sank [but h]igher prices also made steel more expensive for manufacturers that buy it, leading to the loss of about 75,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs, according to a study released late last year by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.

> U.S. President Donald Trump says China pays the tariffs he has imposed on $250 billion of Chinese exports to the United States. 

> But that is not how tariffs work. China’s government and companies in China do not pay tariffs directly. Tariffs are a tax on imports. They are paid by U.S.-registered firms to U.S. customs for the goods they import into the United States.

> Importers often pass the costs of tariffs on to customers - manufacturers and consumers in the United States - by raising their prices.
