- Ricardian model works because of its assumptions

- Ricardo: countries trade because they have .hi[different comparative advantages]
  - Have different comparative advantages because of .hi-purple[different labor productivities]

- Ricardo followed a .hi-purple[labor theory of value]

- But what explains differences in labor productivities? it's (mostly) not innate differences!

&gt; “The .hi[difference of natural talents] in different men is, in reality, .hi[much less than we are aware of]; and...is .hi[not upon many occasions so much the cause, as the effect of the division of labour.] The difference between the most dissimilar characters, between a philosopher and a common street porter, for example, seems to .hi[arise not so much from nature, as from habit, custom, and education.]...[F]or the first six or eight years of their existence, they were perhaps, very much alike...About that age, or soon after, they come to be employed in very different occupations. The difference of talents comes then to be taken notice of, and widens by degrees, till at last the vanity of the philosopher is willing to acknowledge scarce any resemblance. But .hi[without the disposition to truck, barter, and exchange, every man must have procured to himself every necessary and conveniency of life which he wanted.] All must have had the same duties to perform, and the same work to do, and .hi[there could have been no such difference of employment as could alone give occasion to any great difference of talents.]” (Book I, Chapter 1).

&gt; "By the early twentieth century, British textile equipment manufacturers were shipping power looms and other textile equipment around the globe. Mills in India, China, and elsewhere not only used the same equipment as British mills, but they were often run by experienced British managers aided by British master weavers and spinners and engineers. Nevertheless, their output per worker was far less than that of the English or American mills because their workers -- using the exact same machines -- lacked the same knowledge and skills. Western weavers were 6.5 times more productive. The English and American cotton textile industries held a sustained economic advantage for decades, despite paying much higher wages," (pp.18-19).

&gt; "[T]he technical knowledge needed to install, manage, and operate this technology, along with the necessary institutiosn and organizations to allow large numbers of workers to acquire this knowledge, did not appear in these countries for many decades. Cotton textile workers in China, India, and Japan in 1910 had the same machines as those in England, but their productivity was far less than that of the English or American workers because they lacked the same knowledge and skills. Even when English managers ran mills in India and China, productivity tended to be low because the English managers had to adapt their knowledge to a different environment and culture.," (p.98).

# Labor Theory of Value

.pull-left[

- .hi-purple[Labor Theory of Value]

- Neoclassical Economics since the 1870s Marginalist revolution:
  - Value &amp; price is determined by .hi[marginal utility]

- There are other factors of production!
`$$Y=f(L,K,T)$$`

# Labor Theory of Value

.pull-left[

- An easy fix (from Fritz Machlup)

- Instead of labor productivity interpretation, interpret as .hi-purple[opportunity cost]

- Cost of a good `\(x\)` is not amount of labor needed `\((l_x)\)`, it is the amount of other goods given up to release resources to produce marginal `\(x\)`
  - Opportunity cost, relative price of `\(x\)`: `\(\frac{p_x}{p_y}\)` is slope of PPF!

# Extreme Specialization

.pull-left[

- In Ricardian model, trading countries .hi-purple[specialize in *only* producing a single good]

- Due to assumed constant returns, constant marginal product of labor

- This does not happen in real world!
  - Diminishing returns to any one factor, holding others constant

# Domestic Distribution Effects?

.pull-left[

- Ignores effects of international trade on .hi-purple[distribution of income *within* countries]

- Workers just assumed to be homogenous `\(L\)` that can move from any industry to any other
  - Perfect mobility

- In truth, relative price changes from trade will cause gains and losses to different domestic industries

# Short Run Harms?

.pull-left[

- Trade can increase aggregate wealth, but .hi-purple[may leave some individuals worse off] (especially in short run)

- Suppose `\(A \iff B\)` trade

- Then suppose transactions costs fall and `\(A \iff C\)` trade *instead* of `\(A \iff B\)`
  - `\(B\)` is worse off!

- Data and studies can show that trade and GDP level (or growth rate) are strongly correlated

- Major econometric problem: Simultaneous causation! Which causes the other?

# Belassa (1963): UK and US Productivity vs. Exports

- Ricardian model predicts UK exports in industries in where U.S. has smaller productivity advantage

&gt; “Three key features of the Japanese case make it an attractive .hi[natural experiment]. .hi[First, both shortly before and after its opening up in the late 1850s the economy arguably met the key assumptions of the neoclassical trade model]: competitive markets, product homogeneity, and price-taking behavior on international markets. Second, the free trade period used for empirical analysis--the late 1860s through the mid-1870s--predates the importation of foreign production technologies and the rapid transformation of the set of technologies available to the Japanese economy that characterized subsequent economic growth. It also occurs after non-tariff barriers to trade established during the initial opening up had been eliminated. .hi[In short, the opening up to international trade characterizes the main change in the economy during this period. Third, the opening up confronted the Japanese economy with a dramatic change in the vector of relative prices that it faced.] The Western powers so compromised Japan’s tariff autonomy that it had little leverage to cushion the affected sectors of its economy from these price shocks. .hi[Thus, within seven years the country went from nearly complete autarky to virtually free trade],” (p.209).

Our estimates indicate that .hi[significant changes in commodity prices do not necessarily translate into large welfare gains]. It also suggests caution in justifying free trade on the grounds of welfare gains based on static comparative advantage. .hi[Since the dynamic aspects of international trade probably have a much larger impact on national income], future empirical research on the nature and magnitude of these dynamic gains is indispensable.” (p.222).
