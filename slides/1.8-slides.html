# Assumptions of the Specific Factors Model

.pull-left[

.smallest[
- Until now, we've assumed (within each country), factors are mobile

- But in truth, some factors are .hi[specific] or .hi[immobile]: can only be used for the production of a specific set of goods or industry
  - e.g. programmers can only work in software, not in pro-football
  - e.g. equipment used to make beer barrels cannot switch to producing computer chips

   - labor `\((L)\)`
   - capital `\((K)\)`
   - land `\((T)\)`

- .b[Agriculture] is produced using *land* `\((T)\)` and *labor* `\((L)\)`

- Land `\((T)\)` and capital `\((K)\)` are .hi[specific factors], only used to produce one good

- Labor `\((L)\)` is a .hi[mobile factor] that can be used in *either* (or both) sectors

# Setting up the Model: Production Function

.pull-left[

- An economy's production can be described as a set of production functions for manufacturing `\((M)\)` and agriculture `\((A)\)`

`$$\begin{align*}
Q_M&amp;=Q_M(K,L_M)\\
Q_A&amp;=Q_A(T,L_A)\\
\end{align*}$$`

- Each country can only allocate its labor force between two industries

`$$L_M+L_A=\bar{L}$$`

# Allocating the Mobile Factor (Labor)

# A Note About Labor

.pull-left[
.smaller[
- A simple (and very Ricardian) assumption about labor: it is measured in hours, and can equally be applied to each industry

`$$\bar{L}=L_M+L_A$$`

- Every labor hour allocated to agriculture is a labor hour *not* allocated to manufacturing, and vice versa
  - .hi-purple[Opportunity cost of labor]

- Visualize a “labor budget constraint” to understand movements along the PPF

# Allocating Labor

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Shows relationship of moving along PPF `\(\iff\)` reallocating labor across industries

- If all labor in `\(A\)` (point A), country only produces `\(A\)`, no `\(M\)`
- If all labor in `\(M\)` (point D), country only produces `\(M\)`, no `\(A\)`

- Remember, each industry has diminishing returns to labor, and will have a particular `\(MPL\)` depending on how much land or capital there are
  - Hence, a 1 unit `\(\uparrow \downarrow\)` in `\(L\)` in one industry *does not* imply a 1 unit increase in output

&lt;img src="1.8-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="504" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

---

# Allocating Labor

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- As we move to the right of the PPF, we are pulling labor out of agriculture and into manufacturing

- Each single unit of labor we take out of `\(A\)` and put into `\(M\)` will:
  - Lower `\(\downarrow Q_A\)` by `\(MPL_{A}\)`
  - Raise `\(\uparrow Q_M\)` by `\(MPL_{M}\)`

- Or to put it inversely, to produce 1 more unit of `\(M\)`:
  - Reallocate `\(\downarrow L_A\)` input by `\(\frac{1}{MPL_{A}}\)`
  - Reallocate `\(\uparrow L_M\)` input by `\(\frac{1}{MPL_{M}}\)`

# Production Possibilities Frontier

  - Again: .b[“slope”], .b[“relative price of M”], .b[“opportunity cost of M”]
  - Amount of `\(A\)` given up for 1 more `\(M\)`

`$$\underbrace{MRT}_{slope}=-\frac{MPL_A}{MPL_M}$$`

- Note `\(A (y)\)` on top and `\(M (x)\)` on bottom!
  - if you think in our Ricardian terms, `\\(l_x=\frac{1}{MPL_x}\\)` and `\\(l_y=\frac{1}{MPL_y}\\)`, so `\\(\frac{l_x}{l_y} \implies \frac{MPL_y}{MPL_x}\\)`

# Allocating Labor

.pull-left[
.smallest[

- Because of diminishing returns, as we move labor out of `\(A\)` and into `\(M\)`, we lower `\(MPL_M\)` and raise `\(MPL_A\)`

- This is why the PPF has increasing opportunity costs, and is bent inwards the way it is!

- For a given amount of `\(T\)`, `\(K\)`, and `\(L\)`, we can determine the economy's output bundle `\((Q_M, Q_A)\)` by knowing how much labor is allocated across `\((L_M, L_A)\)`

- Now let's find how labor is allocated across industries

# The Demand for Labor in Competitive Industries

.pull-left[
.quitesmall[
- Profit-maximizing firms in competitive labor markets will hire labor (hours) up to the point where the marginal benefit of hiring labor equals the marginal cost
  - .red[Marginal cost per labor-hour]: wage `\(w\)`
  - .blue[Marginal benefit per labor-hour]: marginal revenue product (marginal product `\(\times\)` price of output)

- In manufacturing:

`$$w = MPL_M * P_M$$`

- In agriculture:

`$$w = MPL_A * P_A$$`

- Again, if you want to remember why, see my slides on [Factor Markets](https://ios20.classes.ryansafner.com/slides/1.8-slides.html#1)

]

---

# The Demand for Labor in Both Industries

.pull-left[

- Because we have assumed .hi-purple[labor is mobile] (and homogenous “labor hours”), workers will always move out of a lower-paying industry and into a higher-paying industry

- Thus, in equilibrium, .hi-turquoise[wages `\(w\)` must equalize across both industries], with the implication:

`$$\begin{align*}
(w =) MPL_M * P_M &amp;= MPL_A * P_A (= w)\\
-\frac{MPL_A}{MPL_M} &amp;= - \frac{P_M}{P_A}\\
\end{align*}$$`

]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/equilibriumbalance.png)
]
]

# Labor and the PPF

.pull-left[

- Thus, we finally see how it is that the slope of the PPF is equivalent to the relative price of `\(M\)`

`$$MRT = -\frac{p_M}{p_A}$$`

- (Back to `\(x\)` on top, `\(y\)` on bottom!)

- At the optimum production, PPF is tangent to a value line with slope the relative price of `\(M\)`

# Labor Allocation

.pull-left[
.smallesr[
- We can also visualize the allocation of labor in the country

- Recall both industries in equilibrium must charge the same wage `\(w_M=w_A=w^{\star}\)`

- Moving from left to right, &lt;span style="color:#000066"&gt;labor allocated to manufacturing&lt;/span&gt;, `\(L_M\)`

- Moving from right to left, &lt;span style="color:#33CCFF"&gt;labor allocated to agriculture&lt;/span&gt;, `\(L_A\)`

]

---

# A Change in Relative Prices on Labor Allocation

.pull-left[
.smaller[
- An increase in the relative price of manufacturing `\(\left(\frac{p_M}{p_A}\right)\)` will increase the demand for labor in manufacturing

- Because both industries have to compete for labor, wages do increase, but not as much as the increase in the relative price of manufacturing

- More labor will be used in manufacturing than in agriculture, and thus, the economy will produce more manufacturing and less agriculture

# A Change in Relative Prices on PPF

.pull-left[

- We can equivalently see this on the PPF

- Increase in the relative price of manufacturing

`$$\bigg(\displaystyle\frac{p_M}{p_A}\bigg)^1 \rightarrow \bigg(\displaystyle\frac{p_M}{p_A}\bigg)^2$$`

- Moving from `\(A \rightarrow B\)`
  - Slope steepens
  - Country will produce less agriculture, more manufacturing

- What about land owners?

- Total income to landowners `\(= \underbrace{(P_A * Q_A)}_{\text{Revenues in A}} - \underbrace{(W * L_A)}_{\text{Labor costs}}\)`

- As more labor used in agriculture, `\(\uparrow MP_T\)`: Each piece of land has more workers to work it.

- .hi-purple[Land owners gain]
  - We saw (1) `\(\uparrow\)` relative price of agriculture and (2) `\(\downarrow\)` real wage in terms of agriculture
  - Thus, income to landowners will rise more than proportionately to the rise in relative price of agriculture

# Example of Mobile vs. Specific Labor

.pull-left[
.quitesmall[
- Japan begins exporting cheap cars in 1980s, U.S. consumers import them

- Relative price of cars falls in U.S., U.S. factories produce fewer cars, wages &amp; jobs in U.S. auto manufacturing diminish

- More .hi-purple[mobile] and .hi-purple[nonspecific] workers left Detroit for other industries
  - e.g. maybe they went to Texas to work in booming oil industry

- More .hi-purple[immobile] and .hi-purple[specific] workers lost jobs
