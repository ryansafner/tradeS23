# Economists Speak a Foreign Language...

&gt; Cost, efficiency, welfare, competition, marginal, equilibrium, profit, public good, discrimination, elasticity

# ...But You Can Learn It

# Don't Think You Know It Already!

# Why We Model I

.pull-left[

- Economists often “speak” in models that explain and predict human behavior

- The pure language of models is mathematics
    - things that are universally true, deducible from axioms, can easily spot errors
    - often equations and graphs
    - this is what scares students most about economics

# Why We Model II

.pull-left[

- Economists use conceptual models: fictional constructions to logically examine consequences

- Very different from other sciences
    - No social experiments
    - Purposive, strategic human beings 
    - Introspective understanding

# The Two Major Models of Economics as a “Science”

- Make .hi[tradeoffs] to maximize objectives within constraints

.pull-right[

## Equilibrium

- Agents .hi[compete] with others over **scarce** resources

- Agents .hi[adjust] behaviors based on prices

- .hi[Stable outcomes] when adjustments stop

# About This Course

---

# Learning Goals

By the end of this course, you will: 

1. apply the models of microeconomics (constrained optimization and equilibrium) towards explaining real world behavior of individuals, firms, and governments

2. explore the effects of economic and political processes on market performance (competition, market prices, profits and losses, property rights, entrepreneurship, market power, market failures, public policy, government failures)

3. apply the economic way of thinking to real world issues in writing
