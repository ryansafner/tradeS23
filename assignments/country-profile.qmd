Please **email me** with the country you would like to choose. I will remove countries from this list in the order that I receive emails claiming them.

### Claimed Countries
 You can choose any country **except** for the following that have been claimed:

# Assignment

I want you to compile statistics on your country (described below). You will give a presentation on your country during the last week of class.

## Country at a Glance

Get data from a reputable source (United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, OECD, etc.) on the following statistics. You may write down just the number or descriptor for each of the following on your report.^[You might wish to make a table to organize it.] **For each, please indicate both the source of your data, and the year for the data (try to get the latest possible)**. Note that some countries may not have data available on all statistics (and be sure to not if none is available).

Your presentation should include:

### Macroeconomic Data

2. Real GDP/capita (and growth rate)
3. Unemployment rate
4. Labor force participation rate
