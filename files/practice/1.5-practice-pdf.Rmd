1. What type of good are apples (inferior, necessity, luxury)? Calculate the income elasticity of demand.
2. What type of good are oranges (inferior, necessity, or luxury)? Calculate the income elasticity of demand.

You can can have cereal and milk for breakfast. When milk is /$2/gallon, you consume 5 bowls of cereal per week. When milk increases to /$4/gallon, you consume 4 bowls of cereal per week.
