\item
  Consider the following \emph{Entry game} in normal form. Suppose there
  are two firms, each of whom can choose to Enter a market, or Stay Out.
  If both firms enter, they split the market, each earning \$50. If both
  stay out, each firm earns \$0. If one enters and the other stays out,
  the entrant can act as a monopolist and earns \$100, with the other
  firm earning \$0.
\end{enumerate}

What is the Nash Equilibrium of this game?

  Suppose you are a restaurant in a \textbf{monopolistically
  competitive} industry. Your firm has a constant marginal and average
  cost at \$4 per unit.

  If this were a perfectly competitive market, what would be the market
  price and equilibrium quantity?
\item
  Calculate the (i) consumer surplus, (ii) profit, and (iii) deadweight
  loss at this price and quantity. Show these on the graph.
\item
  Now suppose this firm has market power from a barrier to entry, and
  can operate like a monopolist. What price and quantity does it set?
\item
  Calculate the (i) consumer surplus, (ii) profit, and (iii) deadweight
  loss at this price and quantity. Show these on the graph.
\item
  Now suppose that the firm had earned this market power via
  rent-seeking. From its lobbying efforts, it had convinced the local
  government to require all new restaurants to get a special license,
  making it harder for new entrants to compete in the market. What was
  the most that this firm was willing to spend on lobbying in order to
  get the license requirement?
\item
  If there are 10 identical (in terms of costs and size, if not food or
  brand) restaurants in the industry, and all engage in maximal
  rent-seeking to obtain the license, what is the true total cost of
  market power in this market to society?

  You are a producer of smartphones and have some market power. You have

\[\begin{aligned}
C(q)&=10q^2+200q+1000\\

  What would be the lowest possible price you would need to charge to
  break even?

\item
  Calculate the elasticity of demand at your profit-maximizing price.

where \(q\) tons of bentonite per day and \(p\) is the price per ton.
Bentonite is produced by a monopolist at a constant marginal and average
total cost of \$10 per ton.

  Consider a boat rental firm on a popular beach that has a constant
  average and marginal cost of \$30 per boat hire. It has estimated that
  demand from Locals \((L)\) and demand from Tourists \((T)\) are:
  \[\begin{aligned}
  q_L&=40-0.4p\\
  q_T&=25-0.1p\\

\item
  Suppose it must charge a single price to all customers. Find the
  profit-maximizing quantity, price, and the total profits.
\item
  How much of the price is markup?
\item
  What is the price elasticity of demand at this price?
\item
  Now suppose the firm is able to segment the market and charge
  different prices to Tourists and Locals. Find the profit-maximizing
  quantity, price, and the total profits.
\item
  For each segment of the market: how much of the price is markup, and
  what is the price elasticity of demand at the optimal price? How did
  the price for each segment change from the single price (Part A), and
  why?
