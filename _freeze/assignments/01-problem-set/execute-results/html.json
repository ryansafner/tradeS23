As a way of answering this question, compare the economics of a small isolated island of a few hundred people with the economics of a large scale society of millions.\n\n## Question 2\n\nAdam Smith also uses the example of the philosopher and the porter to talk about the division of labor – arguing that the wide diversity of talents and specialized jobs is not the cause of the division of labor, but one of its effects. Why is this so? Hint: Your answer to the previous question should help explain this.\n\n# Problems\n\n## Question 3\n\nSuppose Vietnam *only* exports clothing, and *only* imports rice. Analyze the impact on Vietnam's terms of trade from the following events.\n\n### Part A\n\nTensions in the region disrupts trade routes delivering rice from abroad.\n\n### Part B\n\nMalaysia stimulates its own clothing-export industry, lowering clothing prices.\n\n### Part C\n\nThere is a massive rice harvest in China.\n\n### Part D\n\nVietnam raises tariffs on rice imports.\n\n### Part E\n\nVietnam lowers tariffs on rice imports.\n\n### Part F\n\nIndia raises tariffs on imported clothing.\n\n## Question 4\n\nSuppose there are two countries, Ruritania and Lideria. Were they to trade, Ruritania has a comparative advantage in raising goats, Lideria has a comparative advantage in mining copper. Following the Ricardian model, explain which country would face a higher autarky relative price of goats, and what happens to the relative price of goats in each country as they open to trade? It may help to sketch a graph, with goats on the horizontal axis, but is not necessary.\n\n## Question 5\n\nThe planet Coruscant and the planet Tatooine can each produce Podracers and Lightsabers. If Coruscant devotes all of its resources, it can produce 75 Podracers, or 300 Lightsabers. If Tatooine devotes all of its resources, it can produce 30 Podracers or 150 Lightsabers. Put podracers on the horizontal axis and lightsabers on the vertical axis.\n\n### Part A\n\nWrite the PPF equation for each planet.\n\n### Part B\n\nGraph the PPF for each planet.\n\n### Part C\n\nWhich planet has an *absolute* advantage in producing each good?\n\n### Part D\n\nWhich planet has a *comparative* advantage in producing each good?\n\n### Part E\n\nWhat will the range of prices be for each good?\n\n## Question 6\n\nSuppose Finland has 250 workers, and Malaysia has 100 workers. It takes 2 workers in Finland to produce 1 lb of rice, and 4 workers to produce 1 lb of fish. It takes 2 workers in Malaysia to produce 1 lb of rice, and 5 workers to produce 1 lb of fish. Put rice on the horizontal axis and fish on the vertical axis.\n\n### Part A\n\nWrite the PPF equation for each country.\n\n### Part B\n\nGraph the PPF for each country.\n\n### Part C\n\nWhich country has an *absolute* advantage in producing each good?\n\n### Part D\n\nWhich country has a *comparative* advantage in producing each good?\n\n### Part E\n\nWhat will the range of prices be for each good?\n\n### Part F\n\nSuppose Malaysia becomes more productive at growing rice, such that it only needs 1 worker to produce 1 lb of rice. Recalculate Malaysia’s PPF equation and re-draw its PPF graph.\n\n### Part G\n\nRecalculate the opportunity costs for both countries and both goods. What has happened to the countries’ comparative advantages?\n\n### Part H\n\nWhat will the *new* range of prices be for each good?\n\n",
