Though as I mentioned in class, you might find [How the Dismal Science Got its Name](https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/LevyPeartdismal.html) insightful and surprising. It is a 6 part series of blog posts based on research by David Levy & Sandra Peart.\n\n- [Part I](https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/LevyPeartdismal.html)\n- [Part II](https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/LevyPeartdismal2.html)\n- [Part III](https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/LevyPeartdismal3.html)\n- [Part IV](https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/LevyPeartdismal4.html)\n- [Part V](https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/LevyPeartdismal5.html)\n- [Part VI](https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/LevyPeartdismal6.html)\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats. Clicking the image will bring you to the html version of the slides in a new tab. The lower button will allow you to download a PDF version of the slides.\n\n::: callout-tip\nYou can type <kbd>h</kbd> to see a special list of viewing options, and type <kbd>o</kbd> for an outline view of all the slides.\n:::\n\nI suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (*not everything* is in the slides)!\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/slides/1.5-slides.html\"><img src =\"/slides/1.5-slides.png\" alt = \"1.5-slides\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-lg\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/slides/1.5-slides.pdf\"><i class=\"fas fa-file-pdf\"></i> Download as PDF</a></p>\n\n```{=html}\n<!--## <i class=\"fas fa-laptop-code\"></i> Assignments\n\n### Preliminary Math Survey Due Next Class\n\nPlease take the [preliminary survey](/assignment/00-preliminary-survey) on your math background by next class.
