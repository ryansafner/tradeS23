Simply solve for the dependent variable on the vertical axis $(x_2$ as if you were solving for $y)$:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](graphing_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\begin{align*}\na_1x_1+a_2x_2=c && \\text{Original}\\\\\na_2x_2=c-a_1x_1  && \\text{Subtracting }x_1 \\text{ term}\\\\\nx_2 = \\frac{c}{a_2}-\\frac{a_1}{a_2}x_1 && \\text{Dividing by }a_2 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\n  - The vertical intercept is $\\frac{c}{a_2}$\n  - The horizontal intercept is $\\frac{c}{a_1}$\n  - The slope is $-\\frac{a_1}{a_2}$\n\n- This is extremely useful for dealing with constraints in constrained optimization problems: [**budget constraints**](/content/1.2-content) and [**isocost lines**](/content/2.2-content)\n\n## Drawing a Graph From an Equation\n\nIf we already have a linear equation that we would like to graph, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Take the equation and plug in two values, e.g. if we have:\n\n$$p = \\frac{1}{2}q + 4$$\n  \n2. We can find two points on the graph. The easiest one to find is the vertical-intercept, where the line crosses the vertical axis, where $q=0$, so plug in $q=0$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\np &= \\frac{1}{2}(0)+4\\\\\np &= 4 \\\\ \\end{align*}\n\nThus, one point is $(0,4)$. Note that the constant in the function itself is the $p-intercept$! So one valid point will always be $(0,b)$!\n\n3. For our second point, let's plug in $q=2$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\np &= \\frac{1}{2}(2)+4\\\\\np &= 5 \\\\ \\end{align*}\n\nThus, another point is $(2,5)$\n\n4. Now, plot the two points on the graph, and connect them with a line\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](graphing_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Note*: A quick shortcut to plot a line is to find the vertical intercept and plot that, and then find the next point using the slope. Here, start our line at 4 on the vertical axis, and then, as the slope is $\\frac{1}{2}$, for every one unit increase in $q$, $p$ increases by $\\frac{1}{2}$. Our second point, (2,5), is a 2 unit increase in $q$ resulting in a $1$ unit increase in $p$.\n\n## Finding an Equation from a Graph\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](graphing_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nIn order to find the equation of an existing line, we follow these steps:\n\n1. First, take two points on the line and find the slope, $a$, between them. Let's pick $(1,6)$ and $(3,2)$.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Slope} &= \\frac{rise}{run} \\\\\n&= \\frac{(p_2-p_1)}{(q_2-q_1)}\\\\\n&= \\frac{(2-6)}{(3-1)}\\\\\n&= \\frac{-4}{2}\\\\\n&= -2\\\\ \\end{align*}\n\n\nThere is a shortcut that we can use to find the slope faster by eye-balling the graph: When $q$ changes by 1, how many units does $p$ change? If we move from (1,6) to (2,5), $q$ increases by 1, but $p$ falls by 2. So the slope is $-2$. For every one unit increase in $q$, $p$ changes by -2.\n\n2. Now with the slope, we need to find the vertical intercept, or $b$, we solve this by plugging in the slope and any point on the graph, we will use (1,6):\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\t\tp &= aq+b\\\\\n\t\t(6) &= -2(1)+b\\\\\n\t\t6 &= -2+b\\\\\n\t\t8 &= b\\\\\n\t\\end{align*}\n\nNote, there is another easy way to eye-ball what this value is. It is simply that $p$ value where $q=0$, or at what $p$ value the graph crosses the vertical axis. We can see it is at 8.\n\n3. Thus, we have the slope and the intercept, so our equation is:\n$$\np = -2q+8\t\n$$\n",
