Here, we take the first, and solve for $x$: \n\n\\begin{align*}\n \t\t12x+4y&=36\\\\\n \t\t12x&=36-4y\\\\\n \t\tx&=3-\\frac{1}{3}y\\\\\n \t\t\\end{align*}\n\nNow we take this value and plug it into the other equation: \n\n\\begin{align*}\n \t\t6x-3y&=3\\\\\n \t\t6(3-\\frac{1}{3}y)-3y&=3\\\\\n \t \t\t18-2y-3y&=3\\\\\n \t \t\t18-5y&=3\\\\\n \t \t\t-5y&=-15\\\\\n \t \t\ty&=3\\\\\n \t\t\\end{align*}\n\nNow that we know the value of one variable, plug it into either of the original equations to solve for the value of the other variable:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n \t\t12x+4y&=36\\\\\n \t\t12x+4(3)&=36\\\\\n \t\t12x+12&=36\\\\\n \t\t12x&=24\\\\\n \t\tx&=2\\\\\n \t\t\\end{align*}\n\nWe should verify that our variables are correct, so plug $x$ and $y$ into each equation and make sure it is true. Let's start with the first equation:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n \t\t12x+4y&=36\\\\\n \t\t12(2)+4(3)&=36\\\\\n \t\t24+12&=36 \\checkmark \\\\\n \t\t\\end{align*}\n\nWe can do the same with the other equation:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n \t\t6x-3y&=3\\\\\n \t\t6(2)-3(3)&=3\\\\\n \t\t12-9&=3 \\checkmark \\\\\n \t\t\\end{align*}\n\n## Elimination\n\nWe will multiply the equations by constants to make the coefficients of one variable equal. Here, let us try to make the coefficients in front of each equation's $x$ equal.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\t\t[12x+4y&=36]*6\\\\\n\t\t[6x-3y&=3]*12\\\\\n\t\\end{align*}\n\nTo do so, we will multiply the first equation by 6, and the second equation by 12. (We multiply each equation by the coefficient in front of the other equation's $x$ variable):  \n\n\\begin{align*}\n\t\t72x+24y&=216\\\\\n\t\t72x-36y&=36\n\t\\end{align*}\n\nNow we subtract the second equation from the first, which should get rid of $x$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\t\t72x+24y&=216\\\\\n\t\t-[72x-36y&=36]\\\\\t\n\t\\end{align*}\n\nBe careful to distribute the minus sign carefully:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\t\t[72x-72x]+[24y-(-36y)]&=[216-36]\\\\\n\t\t60y&=180\\\\\n\t\ty&=3\\\\\n\t\\end{align*}\n\nNow that we have the value of one variable, plug it in to either equation.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n \t\t12x+4y&=36\\\\\n \t\t12x+4(3)&=36\\\\\n \t\t12x+12&=36\\\\\n \t\t12x&=24\\\\\n \t\tx&=2\\\\\n \t\t\\end{align*}\n \nNow that we have both variables, we can plug them in to each equation to double check them, same as before.\n",
