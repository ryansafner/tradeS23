Elasticity measures the percentage change in one variable ($y$) as a response to a 1% change in another ($x$) at a particular value of $x$ and $y$.\n$$\\epsilon_{yx} = \\frac{\\% \\Delta y}{\\% \\Delta x}=\\cfrac{(\\frac{\\Delta y}{y})}{(\\frac{\\Delta x}{x})}\t=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}*\\frac{x}{y}$$\n\n- Interpretation: A 1% change in $x$ will lead to a $\\epsilon_{yx}$% change in $y$\n\nFor example, the **price elasticity of demand** measures the percentage change in quantity demanded to a 1% change in price (at a particular price point), note here: $x=P$ and $y=q$:\n$$\\epsilon_D = \\frac{\\%\\Delta q}{\\%\\Delta p} =  \\cfrac{\\frac{\\Delta q}{q}}{\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}} =\\frac{\\Delta q}{\\Delta p}*\\frac{p}{q}$$\n\n- Note that $\\frac{\\Delta q}{\\Delta p}$ is $\\frac{1}{slope}$ of the demand curve (which is $\\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta q}$)\n- Note though we would technically multiply by $\\frac{100}{100}$ to get percentage change, this term obviously is just 1. Elasticity is unitless.\n- Note also that on a graph we usually express $q$ as our independent variable and $p$ as our dependent variable\n\n## Derivatives (Calculus)\n\nOften, $\\Delta y$ refers to a *very small* change in $y$, a **marginal change** in $y$. A **rate of change** is the ratio of two changes, such as the change between $x$ and $y=f(x)$:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta f(x)}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{f(x + \\Delta x)-f(x)}{\\Delta x}$$\n\n- This measures how $f(x)$ changes as $x$ changes\n- If $\\Delta$ is *infinitesimally small*, then we have expressed the **(first) derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$**, written variously as $f'(x)$ or $\\frac{df(x)}{dx}$\n$$\\frac{d f(x)}{d x} = \\lim_ {\\Delta x \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + \\Delta x)-f(x)}{\\Delta x}$$\n\nThe derivative of a linear function $(y=ax+b)$ is a constant (i.e. the slope), $a$ \n$$\\frac{d f(x)}{d x} = a$$\n\nThe derivative of the first derivative is the **second derivative** of a function $f(x)$ with respect to $x$, denoted  $f''(x)$ or $\\frac{d^2f(x)}{dx^2}$\n\n- The second derivative measures the *curvature* of a function\n- It used for proving when a function has reached a maximum or minimum, or is concave or convex (often used in [#Nonlinear-Functions-&-Optimization](optimization))\n",
