Nobody produces something like this without a lot of inspiration and guidance from those who have already done this before. Here, I try to give credit where it is due, and slowly begin to document how I made everything, for those who eventually want to do what I did.

This website is written in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), pushed to [Github](https://github.com/ryansafner/lawS21), and hosted by [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

The theme is based on [Academia-hugo](https://github.com/themefisher/academia-hugo), which I modified.

The inspiration for making individual course websites, along with the basic structure, comes from the incomparable [Andrew Heiss](https://andrewheiss.com). See his website for examples, as well as a number of helpful tutorials. Sadly, I had to figure out how these websites work on my own, and attempted to document my process in the README of [this repository](https://github.com/ryansafner/classwebtest) for those interested. One day I may make a guide.

The course hex sticker I made via [hexSticker](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker), and keep all of my course hex stickers in [this repository](https://github.com/ryansafner/hexstickers).
